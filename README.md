# Image_Similarity Search

## Project Description
In this report we will be discussing our approach for implementing image similarity search using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and then using KNN classifier to find similar images.
We are using Imagenette dataset as the input to our model to extract the features’ vector which will be used to find more similar images. This is essentially like the ‘Google Reverse Image Search’.
